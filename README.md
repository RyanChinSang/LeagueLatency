# League Latency

A Graphical UI that provides real-time Statistics and Graphs about your ping (latency) to the League of Legends NA or LAN server.

## How to Install
League Latency is currently not ported to a Windows .exe just yet... but, it soon will!
In the meanwhile we will need to follow a "much-longer-than-I-want-to-have" installation process.
It is still simple! But not simple for everyone.

### Step 1: Get Python

####1. Find out your Windows version (64-bit or 32-bit) [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system).

####2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/):
1. If you are on 64-bit Windows, download the latest Python 2.7 installer [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.amd64.msi).
2. If you are on 32-bit Windows, download the latest Python 2.7 installer [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.msi).

####3. Install Python:
1. Run the installer when download completes.
    1. During installation:

            2. Click the red 'x' and select **Will be installed on local hard drive**.

        2. Append
            * Path
            `%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Scripts\`

    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.`
    then, congratulations!
    2. If the message is:

## About
* **Bio**: My name is `Ryan Kevin Chin Sang`. I am a 3rd Year student at the [Univeristy of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad](http://sta.uwi.edu/) currently pursuing a **BSc. Electrical and Computer Engineering** focusing on the Communications and Computers thematic double-major. As I am a 'college' student, my free-time is very limited. As it stands, my time is always split squarely between Schoolwork (studying, doing assignments/labs, researching) and 'Me'-time (playing League of Legends, spending time with the gf, house-hold duties, etc.). The time I can spend on developing LeagueLatency is very small... but I love developing and I make sure to spend a fair amount of time on it, anyway.
