v1.9a to v2.0a
tldr; A much nicer UI, theme and colour coded statistics!
1- Changed the theme for matplotlib from ''fivethirtyeight'' to 'seaborn-darkgrid'
2- Took all the Ping statistics out of one single, opaque legend and put each in their own text-box
3- Text boxes are color coded based on very simple logic:
   a. For Ping:
        - [RED] If the current ping, at any instance is less than 90% or more than 110% of the current average ping.
        - [GREEN] If within the above range.
        - [BLUE] For no change (if current ping and current avg has the same value). This should very rarely occur.
   b. For Average:
        - [RED] If the current ping is higher than current average, as this causes the average to go up.
        - [GREEN] If the current ping is lower than current average, as this causes the average to go down.
        - [BLUE] For no change (if current ping and current avg has the same value). This should very rarely occur.
4- Reposition the Radio Buttons for aesthetics.
5- Reposition and tuned the opacity of my signature on the interface.

v2.0a to v2.1a
tldr; Stability and Buttons!
1- Fixed bug where avg_lis and xar (ltimes) were of different lengths on "random" occasions.
2- Added conversion to numpy arrays to solidify error-proof-ness.
3- Revised and reduced the number of globals initialized and called within functions.
4- Many logic enhancements.
5- The addition of the Pause/Play button to pause progress of the Pinging.
6- The addition of the Quit button - no longer have to close the window.
7- Unified the placements of text data.
8- Added some comments. (to be continued!)

v2.1a to v2.1b (27.09.16)
tldr; RENAMED and UI improvements and updates
Note: Most of these changes should have made it into v2.1a
1- Changed name from 'LoLPing' to 'LeagueLatency' as this is a much more unique name.
2- Updated the icon of the program so match the new name.
3- Updated and cleaned everything on Git.
4- Made the status text next to the pause/play button look seamless into the button itself.
5- Restructured parts of the code so that it makes more sense.
6- Renamed the class 'Index' to 'button_handler', because that is essentially what it does.
7- Added alot comments! ("good enough" for now but, as always, to be continued!)
8- Added changelog from undocumented v1.9a
