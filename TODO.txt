HIGH:
1. Add custom navigation toolbar:
    - Looks much more modern
    - Functions are much smoother and updated (advanced)
    - Add a Quit button to this navtoolbar
2. Port as a fully functional, standalone .exe for Windows
3. Make an updater. Or at the very least, an icon/hotlink to the Git repo on the GUI itself (Req. HIGH #2)
4. Make functionality to switch between ping summary mode and graphing mode
    - Ping summary mode shows the ping summary circle (implemented in v2.2a) and a ping value readout
    - Graphing mode is the default (current) window
5. Fix: When 'Paused' the graph is still in animation mode:
    - This does not allow static functionality (eg. zooming into the graph) - it resets (animates) at the same (or faster?) rate

MED:
1. Add file menu with "Help" and "About"
   - [Help]>Commands: Shows all the Keyboard Shortcuts
   - [About] Shows information of Dev, version, and version date
   - [Help]>Information: Shows detailed information of the Ping summary circle
2. Show other statistics:
    - # Packets Sent
    - # Packets Received
    - # Packets Lost
    - Loss %
3. Add some sort of diagnosis for when timeout or unreachable errors occur
4. Add radio buttons for simplification toggling
    - Show/Unshow some data
    - Show/Unshow some (corresponding, where applicable) graphs

LOW:
1. Add definition of the task ranks
2. Stop prompting the user for Timeouts or Unreachables after the data arrays are larger than 1
   - This allows seamless continuation of graphing and statistics
3. Simplification/Revision of the code
4. Quantify 'small', 'medium', 'large' with regards to ping spikes
