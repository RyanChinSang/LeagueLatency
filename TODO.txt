Info:
HIGH: If accomplished would add very meaningful functionality. These are usually challenging to accomplish.
MED : If accomplished would make the program more informative and user-friendly.
LOW : If accomplished would add more meaning to either or both of documentation and presentation.

HIGH:
1. Add custom navigation toolbar:
    - Looks much more modern
    - Functions are much smoother and updated (advanced)
    - Add a Quit button to this navtoolbar
2. Port as a fully functional, standalone .exe for Windows
3. Make an updater. Or at the very least, an icon/hotlink to the Git repo on the GUI itself (Req. HIGH #2)
4. Make functionality to switch between ping summary mode and graphing mode
    - Ping summary mode shows the ping summary circle (implemented in v2.2a) and a ping value readout
    - Graphing mode is the default (current) window
5. Fix: When 'Paused' the graph is still in animation mode:
    - This does not allow static functionality (eg. zooming into the graph) - it resets (animates) at the same (or faster?) rate
7. The program needs a drastic speed enhancement:
    - Perform testing to get current performance values, such as:
      a. time it takes to draw a new point/update the graph from the immediately previous update
      b. get the total time in which a. becomes intolerable (2 seconds?)
      c. get the length of the arrays when b. occurs

MED:
1. Add file menu with "Help" and "About"
   - [Help]>Commands: Shows all the Keyboard Shortcuts
   - [About] Shows information of Dev, version, and version date
   - [Help]>Information: Shows detailed information of the Ping summary circle
2. Show other statistics:
    - # Packets Sent
    - # Packets Received
    - # Packets Lost
    - Loss %
3. Add some sort of diagnosis for when timeout or unreachable errors occur
4. Add radio buttons for simplification toggling
    - Show/Unshow some data
    - Show/Unshow some (corresponding, where applicable) graphs

LOW:
2. Stop prompting the user for Timeouts or Unreachables after the data arrays are larger than 1
   - This allows seamless continuation of graphing and statistics
3. Simplification/Revision of the code
4. Quantify 'small', 'medium', 'large' with regards to ping spikes
5. Add more advanced linking logic;
   Problem: ypings and rpings all always add adjacent points to its current contents;
   Fixed by:
   a. interpolating between values
   b. more precise logic for linking the values
